# Distributed Systems Assignments

This repository contains implementations and documentation for two assignments submitted as part of a distributed systems course.

- Assignment 1: RPC (Python) and RMI (Java) implementations with instructions to host the server in AWS EC2.
- Assignment 2: Torrent creation and simple seeding/downloading scripts using `libtorrent`.

The code and writeups are written in a student style.

See the folders:

- `rpc/` — Python XML-RPC server and client.
- `rmi/` — Java RMI interface, implementation, server and client.
- `torrent/` — Python scripts to create a `.torrent` and simple seeder/downloader examples.

Make sure to read the per-folder README files for run instructions and AWS deployment notes.
